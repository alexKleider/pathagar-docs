            <para>A Raspberry Pi (model 2 is preferable but the B is OK)</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>A microUSB charger >= 2Amp rating.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>A USB Wi-fi dongle
            <footnote><para>
            Many of the Wi-fi dongles on the market limit the
            number of clients (often only 5 or 6) making them 
            unsuitable for server use.  The
            canakit.com 
            CanaKit RSP-Pi-WIFI1
            is not subject to this limit. (We've tested it
            and found it to work with up to 26 clients.)
            The price (11.95) is reasonable but shipping is
            costly so buying in bulk makes sense.

        The CanaKit Pi 2 Starter Kit includes the Pi, a
        charger and a Wi-fi dongle as well as other things.

    <title>Raspbian</title>
    <para>Using your personal computer (in this context assumed to
    be a Debian based Linux system) set up a project directory, and
    beneath that another directory into which to download the image.
    From within the latter directory, 'wget' the rapbian image. This
    can all be accomplished with the following commands.
    <programlisting>
    <prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>cd</userinput>
    <prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>mkdir Project</userinput>
    <prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>cd Project</userinput>
    <prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>mkdir Images</userinput>
    <prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>cd Images</userinput>
    <prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>wget https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_latest</userinput>
    </programlisting>
    The <link
    xlink:href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/" >
    Raspbian download site</link> provides the 
    <acronym>SHA-1</acronym> (of the form
    97888fcd9bfbbae2a359b0f1d199850852bf0104)
    which can be checked using the following command.
    <programlisting>
    <prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>sha1 2016-2-26-raspbian-jessie.zip</userinput>
    </programlisting>
    To unzip the image:
    <programlisting>
    <prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>unzip 2016-2-26-raspbian-jessie.zip</userinput>
    </programlisting>
    It is extremely important to know with certainty how your host
    names your sd card.  This can be assertained by running the
    mount command before and than again after inserting the card
    into your computer's card reader.  After insertion there'll
    be one (or possibly more) extra line(s) of output, the beginning
    of which will be of the form 
    <screen>    dev/sdb1 on ....</screen>/.
    The "/dev/sdb" is the crucial part (without the final integer.)
    Make a note of it.  If it isn't "/dev/sdb", substitute what ever
    it is for "/dev/sdb" in the following code.
    <programlisting>
    <prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>sudo dd if=~/Project/Images/2016-2-26-raspbian-jessie.img of=/dev/sdb bs=1M</userinput>
    </programlisting>
