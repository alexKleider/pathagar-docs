    The goal of this document, a project of olpcSF.org, is to provide 
    helpful documentation of the pathagar book server project and more
    specifically to help with installation, configuration and usage 
    of this service software on low energy requiring hardware.  We begin
    with the DreamPlug but hope eventually to gain and report experience
    with other platforms such as CuBox, TrimSlice, and perhaps others.
