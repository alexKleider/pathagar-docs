This directory (/home/alex/Docbook/pathagar-docs)
(with the following repo:
git checkout https://github.com/alexKleider/pathagar-docs)
initially contained my write up of how Sameer and I installed pathagar
on a virtual environment and included in these notes we also covered
installing onto a dreamplug.
That write up is  "bluebook.xml" (because my original notes were in a
blue book.)

As of mid March, 2014, we are beginning a new project documenting the
currently recommended methods of installing pathagar.  We are beginning
by detailing how we do this on a dreamplug but may eventually expand
this to include other platforms.  Currently the CuBox and the TrimSlice
are on our list of 'other platforms' to study.
This project is also being written using docbook and the top level file
is "patHowto.xml".  The plan is for included xml files to all be named
according to the following format: 'patAnotherSubject.xml'.

Sameer Verma, Aaron Borden and Alex Kleider met January 19, 2016
and decided it was time to improve Pathagar documentation.
Bringing this repository up to date is to be my job.
The existing version (prior to commencement of this project) is to be
tagged v0.0.a
